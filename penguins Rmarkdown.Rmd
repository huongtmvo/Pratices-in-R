CLick Command + Option + I for new code chunk
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(penguins)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm,y=body_mass_g,color=species))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
